Hello, my name is Jason, I'm a Canadian student with a passion for software development and fixing challenging problems.

I'm familiar with a variety of programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java. I have experience with web development and app development, and I'm always looking to learn more.

In particular, I have a soft spot for older Apple computers and software. I have ported numerous applications and frameworks to older versions of macOS and Mac OS X, including Discord and Java 21 to decade-old releases of macOS and a modern and secure web browser to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (circa 2009).

I've also created several low-level patches for running modern versions of macOS on unsupported hardware, including a Kext (Kernel Extension) to provide support for certain unsupported AMD video cards, another Kext to restore support for keymappings on 15 year-old Macs, a method to unlock OpenCL on patched graphics drivers, and many more, which I often contribute to the OpenCore Legacy Patcher project.
