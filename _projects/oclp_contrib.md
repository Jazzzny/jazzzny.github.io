OpenCore Legacy Patcher is a comprehensive tool for installing modern macOS on unsupported Macs.

I have contributed heavily to the project by adding support for various pieces of hardware, restoring software features, fixing bugs, and improving the application UI experience.

I have also written documentation and guides for the project, including a guide for installing Windows via OCLP, and I have provided countless hours of support to users on the project's Discord server.

**A brief selection of some of my proudest contributions to the project include:**
